            Movie Phone, who remembers looking through a newspaper to find the
            show times of the movie you wanted to see ? Who remembers calling
            the movie phone number and finding out information regarding what
            time the movie started or where ? Well...we no longer have to do
            that anymore thanks to the smart phones in all of our pockets. Movie
            Phone here is streamlined. No more newspapers no more phone calls.
            Movies appear on the screen and information is presented.
